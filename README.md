# hpython
Python code reference for everyone.

Everyone is welcome to colaborate, edit, write and add files, you just need to fork the repo, write your changes or extras and ask for **pull request!**

All files must show a functionality or examples from python, please comment your code.

## Coduct
- Zero tolerance to any missconduct or missbehaviour, code, comments and filenames should be respectful.
- Code should be in English, it is ok if any word in spanish slips through it, but will need to be corrected.
- Please practice KISS and Clean Code whenever possible.
- Have fun.

## Advise
In order to get a grasp of some concepts, code should be downloaded and ran in your machine, so you can see the output yourself.
you can use **python <script.py>**, if you have python 2 and 3 running on your system, you might need to use **python3 <script.py>** instead.
